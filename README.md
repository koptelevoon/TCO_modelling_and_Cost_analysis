**1)	Project overview**<br />
-----------------------------
This project develops a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) model for two versions of an innovative Energy Storage solution. The model considers a complete overview of cost implications based on varying life-cycle design choices and supports data-driven decision making in system development.<br /><br />

**2)	Objective**<br />
- Quantify total life-cycle TCO costs for two versions of an energy storage system<br />
- Identify critical cost drivers across the supply chain<br />
- Support strategic decisions under uncertainty using scenario and sensitivity analysis<br /><br />

**3)	Scope of the model**<br />
The TCO model covers all phases of the system life-cycle<br />
- Pre-development & consenting<br />
- Procurement<br />
- Assembly<br />
- Installation & Commissioning<br />
- Operation & Maintenance<br />
- Decommissioning & disposal<br /><br />

Total costs are discounted by the time period in which they are incurred to reflect time value of money<br /><br />

**4)	Methodology**<br />
- Bottom-up cost modeling in **Excel** based on variable cost complexities for the different phases of the system life-cycle<br />
- Cost drivers are based on a set of parameters and assumptions (e.g. capacity, distance between installed units, scaled installation operations, etc)<br />
- Discounted cash flow logic <br />
- Total TCO cost scenario analyses between and within both designs based on input parameter sensitivity and component-cost fluctuations<br /><br />

**5)	Key scenario analyses performed**<br />
- Power capacity [MW] vs. Volume capacity [MWh]<br />
- Installation economies of scale [# units] vs. Installation distance between units [km]<br />
- Lifecycle duration [years] vs. discount rate impact [%]<br />
- Component-cost fluctuation analysis<br /><br /><br />

**6)	Key insights**<br />
- The total TCO difference of 55.8% difference is observed between both models (ceteris paribus). This is largely due to a larger necessity in required steel components<br />
- Cost uncertainty is highest for steel-intensive components and structural elements<br />
- Installation economies of scale significantly reduce unit costs<br />
- System capacity increases have non-linear cost effects (Procurement, installation, maintenance)<br /><br />

**7)	Decision support value**<br />
The model enables:<br />
- Early-stage design comparison<br />
- Identification of cost-sensitive parameters<br />
- Better-informed investment and engineering trade-offs<br />
- Supply chain–aware system design decisions<br /><br />

**7)	Skills demonstrated**<br />
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) modeling<br />
- Supply chain cost analysis<br />
- Scenario & sensitivity analysis<br />
- Data-driven decision support<br />
- Excel-based analytical modeling<br />
- Engineering–supply chain translation
